# Yoshi Run

## Description

    This project is about Yoshi, who is part of a loop of random obstacles coming his way. The goal is, jump over the obstacles as the timer rolls; and you score a point every time you successfully jump over the obstacle.

    It has a very simple and clean design. You just have to click on the button in the main page, and that will redirect you to the game.
